------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deliberate deviations of cdrskin from cdrecord compatibility:

+ cdrskin does drive operations (on its drive 0) without a dev= option
  (Note: cdrecord meanwhile has a default for missing dev= option.) 

+ gracetime=0 is allowed and set by default

+ -pad is always set for audio tracks

+ -sao is default where possible, -tao is default where needed 
  (Note: cdrecord write mode defaults have changed in cdrtools-2.01.01a20)

+ driveropts=burnfree is default if the drive supports buffer underrun
  protection. If desired, use driveropts=noburnfree to disable this feature.

+ premature end of source is not an error and leads to full announced tracksize

+ -msinfo pushes all other messages to stderr. It works independently of
  other options which would prevent it with cdrecord (-atip, -scanbus, ...)

+ DVD track sources get not concateneated to a single track. In general DVD
  writing is quite different from cdrecord-ProDVD:
  DVD-R[W] "Disc-at-once" (-sao) is nearest to cdrecord-ProDVD's methods.
  DVD-R[W] "Incremental Streaming" (-tao) on unformatted media allows
  multi-session and track sources of unpredictable size.
  Writing DVD-RAM, DVD+RW and "Restricted Overwrite" DVD-RW is like single
  track -tao on blank CD. Formatting is done via cdrskin-specific
  blank=format_overwrite and not with option -format.

+ DVD-RW get blanked fast only with option blank=deformat_sequential_quickest .
  Option blank=fast is the same as blank=all in order to achieve media which
  are capable of Incremental Streaming.
  
+ It has not been evaluated how far -isosize is compatible with the original
  cdrecord option. man cdrecord forbids stdin as source, cdrskin allows it
  if a fifo is used.

More ore less concise description.

---------------------------------- End of Format

20 Aug 2006  [committed together with next change, i fear]
libburn/sg.c
Hopefully fixed a file descriptor resource leak in sg_grab().
All scanned drives (seem to) stay open once, the grabbed one got re-opened
and its stored first file descriptor got forgotten. Now we try to detect
and re-use the still open fd.

21 Aug 2006  [committed]
libburn/libburn.h
libburn/sg.c
libburn/init.c

cdrskin/cdrskin.c [committed later as revision 11]
O_EXCL experiments imported from cdrskin-0.1.3
In default configuration and on compliant kernels expect that a busy drive is
invisible to further cdrskin instances. The user gets hints in case of empty
bus scan result resp. busy drive given with dev=...
Wether cdrecord and cdrskin respect each other would have to be evaluated.
Options to play with:
 --demand_a_drive   exit !=0 on bus scans with empty result
 --drive_abort_on_busy  abort process if busy drive is found
                    (might be triggered by a busy hard disk)
 --drive_blocking   try to wait for busy drive to become free
                    (might be stalled by a busy hard disk)
 --drive_not_exclusive  do not ask kernel to prevent opening
                    busy drives. Effect is kernel dependend.
 grab_drive_and_wait=<num>  grab drive, wait given number of
                    seconds, release drive, and do normal work

the original.

                                    TODO
===============================================================================


--------------------------------- bugs -------------------------------------


- Do something about drive->buffer asynchronous race conditions
  and dangerous use of local heap memory.
  (The various asynchronous operations use the same buffer
   pointer in struct burn_drive and let it point to
   their private memory.
   Of course, any problem is due to faulty application
   ... but then it is really hard to detect.)

- Why are DVD+R tracks labeled "invisible" by dvd+rw-mediainfo ?
  Why does the DVD drive only show the first session ?
READ TRACK INFORMATION[#5]:
 Track State:           invisible
 Track Start Address:   954960*2KB
 Free Blocks:           0*2KB
 Track Size:            22784*2KB
 ROM Compatibility LBA: 265696


------------------------------ end of bugs ---------------------------------

Support for BD-R SRM+POW

? Provide an option to open track source file O_DIRECT ?
  (needs read chunks much larger than 2 kB)

? Enable profile 0x42 BD-R random recording

Provide DVD+R DL layer break setter

Check all SORRY and FATAL errors whether they should become FAILUREs

problem with telltoc: double descriptor list from before load and after load 


What about cdrskin rc files ? Forward with fallback runs ?


  []
Emulate -dummy on overwriteables ?

  []
Emulate -dummy on DVD+R ?



What about minimum track sizes ? (POWER OFF/ON , BUS RESET ?)


After cooking: review of -do_diet ?

growisofs.c : _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION CAP_SYS_RAWIO SYS_capset ?


Rectify mmc_read_atip speed interpretation. 12x media are reported as 10x. I never heard of 6x media. 


----------------------------------------- long term intentions:

-reset: ioctl(fd,CDROMRESET)  ioctl(fd,SG_SCSI_RESET,SG_SCSI_RESET_DEVICE)
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/robustmutexes/src/fusyn.hg/Documentation/ioctl/cdrom.txt


  []
Convert burn_print() into libdax_msgs_submit()

  []
Clear outdated persistent read buffer after small CD image was read (ticket 57)


===============================================================================
                   This is the dirty end of the todo list.
          The recent changelog entries are above the headline "TODO".
